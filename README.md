# TABLEAU-Visualizations

- Few visualizations created in Tableau to keep those cells flowing in my Blood.
- Created different worksheets with appropriate titles to showcase what scenario I am trying to visualize over here.
- Used Parameters, Calculated Fields, Analytics etc. and provided filters to enable viewers to play around.
- The dataset used is also present in the repo.
- If someone views these and has some feedback or comment, I will be absolutely delighted to take them.
